Bloc Folder

- Bloc folder is used to handle every event on a page, change the state of data on buttons, access pages, and so on

```dart
class LoginBloc extends Bloc<LoginEvent, LoginState> {
  LoginBloc() : super(LoginState()) {
    on<SubmittedLogInEvent>(_submitLogInClicked);
    on<EmailLoginEvent>(_emailEvent);
    on<PasswordLoginEvent>(_passwordEvent);
  }
}
```

Components Folder

- The Components folder is used to create a reusable widget that can later be used from multiple pages

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: onTap,
      child: Container(
        height: height,
        width: width,
        alignment: Alignment.center,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: color,
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5),
          border: border,
        ),
        child: title != ''
            ? Text(
                title,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 12, fontWeight: FontWeight.w600, color: fontTextColor),
              )
            : Icon(
                icons,
                color: Colors.white,
                size: 25,
              ),
      ),
    );
```

Models

- Represent data in the form of objects that have attributes and methods. Objects are modular units that can interact with other objects via messages.

```dart
class Users {
  final String name;
  final String uid;
  final String email;

  Users({this.name = '', this.uid = '', this.email = ''});

  factory Users.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return Users(
      uid: json['uuid'],
      name: json['name'],
      email: json['email'],
    );
  }

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
        'uid': uid,
        'name': name,
        'email': email,
      };
}
```

Repository

- The Repository Folder aims to allow applications to connect to perform queries directly with Firebase

Route
